<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
    <li>1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat: add sugar, and beans. Cook until beans are bright green and tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain, and place in a large bowl of ice water to stop cooking.</li>
    <li>Combine the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook until butter melts. Stir in the garlic; cook until pale beige and fragrant. Stir in the beans; cook until wilted, and garlic is dark brown, about 4 minutes. Toss beans with parsley and lemon zest, and cook 1 to 2 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer beans to a serving dish, and garnish with lemon wedges.</li>
